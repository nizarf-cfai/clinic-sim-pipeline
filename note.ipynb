He reports feeling nauseous and has had a poor appetite. He hasn\\'t been taking his Lactulose regularly because \"it makes me run to the loo too much.\" He has also missed several doses of his Furosemide and Propranolol.

The portal vein appears patent but possibly narrowed.]]\\n\\n\\n   FINDINGS:\\n   The liver is significantly reduced in size with an irregular, nodular contour and diffusely increased echogenicity, consistent with chronic changes. The hepatic parenchyma demonstrates a coarse and heterogeneous echotexture. The spleen is enlarged, measuring approximately 15 cm in craniocaudal dimension. A large volume of anechoic fluid is present throughout the peritoneal cavity, consistent with significant ascites. The bowel loops are diffusely thickened and appear to be floating within the ascites. The portal vein is visualized and appears patent, though its caliber may be reduced. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The kidneys are normal in size and echogenicity. No focal intra-abdominal masses are identified.\\n   \\n   IMPRESSION:\\n   Findings are highly suggestive of decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis with significant ascites.
